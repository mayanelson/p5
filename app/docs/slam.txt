Slamuel(Slam) Lubelsky is a 17 year old high school senior at Stuyvesant High School.  He will graduate high school by the end of June and will be enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis by the fall, where he will probably study Computer Science and Mathematics.  He was born on June 29, 2005 in Manhattan in New York City, where he continues to live to this day(though he will soon live in St. Louis).

	In terms of personality, Slam is pretty shy, kinda awkward, and a generally easygoing person, though he can be somewhat pessimistic at times.  In his free time, Slam likes playing videogames(both single and multiplayer), reading, watching good movies, and he watches a lot of youtube(though he wishes he wouldn’t), among many other small things Slam likes to do.

	Slam intends on studying computer science and mathematics in college, though he is not very sure on this and is open to many other careers.  He thinks it would be very cool to have a career where he does something in machine learning, though he is unsure how easy that might be to do without a masters or a graduate degree.  In college, along with CS and Math, he is interested in taking classes in Psychology, Economics, physics, and political science.  He is also interested in continuing to learn Spanish in college, eventually planning on studying abroad in Spain.

	Slam also likes to be funny and to say things that surprise people. E.x. Ameer: “I’m sorry”.
Slam: “You Should be.”
